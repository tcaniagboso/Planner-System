Overview
The NUPlannerSystem codebase is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing event
schedules for users. It enables the creation, modification, and deletion of events within
user-specific schedules, ensuring no time overlaps between events. The system assumes familiarity
with basic scheduling concepts and is built to cater to environments where managing multiple events
efficiently is crucial. It assumes that users will have unique identifiers and that events can span
across different times and potentially locations, both physical and online.

Quick Start
To get started with NUPlannerSystem, you'll first need to create a PlannerSystem instance.
Then, copy the XML files in the 'test' folder and paste them outside the 'src' folder.
You can read schedules from XML files, create new events, and save schedules back to XML.

Here's a simple example:

java
Copy code
File xmlFile = new File("userSchedule.xml");
PlannerSystem system = new NUPlannerSystem();

// Read a user's schedule from an XML file
system.readUserSchedule(xmlFile);

// Create a new event
system.createEvent("userId", "Event Name", "Monday", "0900", "Monday", "1000", false, "Library");

// Save the updated schedule to an XML file
system.saveUserSchedule("userId");
