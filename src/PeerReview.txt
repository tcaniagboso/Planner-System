Design Critique
We must commend the providers for delivering code that was notably easy to reuse and adapt.
Their architectural choices not only facilitated integration into our existing system but also
inspired us to enhance our own designs. Specifically, their use of interfaces prompted us to create
an ISchedule interface for our Schedule class, and both a ReadOnlyEvent and IEvent interface for our
event class. This has significantly improved the flexibility and scalability of our code.

The simplicity of the code is commendable; it allows for ease of use without requiring an in-depth
understanding of how the views are implemented. The views themselves are well-designed and robust,
effectively handling various user interactions and data presentations with considerable finesse.

However, there were a few areas where the design could be improved. In certain instances, the raw
class was used instead of its corresponding interface, which goes against the best practices of
programming to interfaces not implementations. This could potentially limit the flexibility of the
code and its adaptability to future changes. Additionally, some fields in various classes were not
declared as final when they could have been, which would ensure immutability where appropriate.
There were also opportunities to limit the scope of some variables by declaring them as local
variables instead of class fields, enhancing the clarity and maintainability of the code.

Additionally, we had to implement their controller ourselves, as our controller significantly
differed from theirs in terms of design pattern and functionality. Our system uses the command
callback design pattern, which is closely aligned with the command design pattern, while they
employ a features-based design pattern. Understanding the interaction between their views and
their controller facilitated a straightforward implementation. It's important to note that this
situation is not a pitfall of their design decisions but rather a clash of different design patterns
from two distinct groups.

Overall, the provided codebase is well-constructed and thoughtfully designed, with only minor
issues regarding optimal practices in code encapsulation and interface usage.

Implementation Critique

Once again, their implementations are solid and effective. However, one of the challenges we
encountered was the absence of methods for reading user schedules from an XML file, saving user
schedules to an XML file, and scheduling events within their model interface. Instead, all these
functions are expected to be directly handled by their controller. This was somewhat challenging,
but we managed to find a workaround.

From their view implementations, it appears that there could be a clash between the view and
controller when the planner system model throws an internal exception. The controller will display
to the user that the model failed to perform the specific tasks, while the view might display to the
user that the model successfully performed the task because the view only checks if all the event
fields were filled. This discrepancy seems to arise because they assume that the client will always
create an ideal event, leading to unrealistic expectations. Making the controller handle exceptions
from the view and model will be a good way to fix this clash.

Additionally, we observed that clicking on an existing event displays all system users as invitees,
even though only actual invitees have the event in their schedules. It appears their intention is
to ensure that only system users can be invited. However, this approach might lead to confusion.
Users checking an eventâ€™s details without intending to modify or delete it may struggle to identify
the actual invitees.

Lastly, they could abstract the displaying of error messages by having a method in the view classes
that takes in a string and displays the error messages. This would centralize error handling and
make the user interface code cleaner and more maintainable. Once again, their implementation is very
good and demonstrates powerful capabilities.

Documentation Critique:
Their documentation is impressively clear and straightforward. Utilizing their documentation, we
easily adapted their CentralSystem and comprehended the functionalities of methods throughout the
provided interfaces and view implementations. The JavaDoc-style documentation is notably concise and
direct, greatly easing our integration process. However, there was a minor inconsistency where the
methods in the IFeatures interface were documented using single-line comments rather than the
standard JavaDoc style. Additionally, some of the method names in the ICentralSystem interface were
initially confusing due to their similarity. However, the JavaDoc-style documentation provided
essential clarifications, effectively resolving any ambiguities.

Code limitations:
Currently, there is a significant limitation where if a non-host user attempts to remove an event,
it is deleted from everyone's schedule rather than just their own. Ideally, this should be adjusted
so that the view sends the selected user to the controller instead of the host so that only the
event host can remove an event from all schedules, while other users can only remove the event from
their personal schedule. Additionally, the view lacks built-in support for displaying an empty
schedule; clients are required to input an empty schedule to achieve this. Enhancing the view
implementation to automatically show an empty calendar when no user is selected would be a
beneficial improvement. Despite these issues, the overall quality of the provided code is
outstanding.

Conclusion:
We feel fortunate to have them as our providers, making this project considerably easier for us.
