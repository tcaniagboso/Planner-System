What We Learned

Adopting Interfaces for Flexibility: Before collaborating with our provider, we had reservations
about representing our Schedule and Event classes through interfaces, assuming these classes
represented final implementations that would not require extensions or variations. However, after
integrating our provider's code, we recognized the benefits of abstraction. Consequently, we
introduced an ISchedule interface for handling different scheduling behaviors, a ReadOnlyEvent
interface, and an IEvent interface for the Event class. The introduction of the ReadOnlyEvent
interface, in particular, facilitated the safe passing of event data to our EventView class solely
for display purposes, enhancing security and data integrity.

Reducing Coupling for Enhanced Modularity: Our engagement with customers highlighted the importance
of reducing coupling within our system, particularly in our view implementations. While we have not
achieved minimal coupling, our efforts have significantly improved the modularity of our views.
By limiting the dependency of our views on methods from other classes—which may not be shareable
with our customers—we have streamlined integration and maintenance processes. This approach not
only simplifies our customers' tasks but also enhances the adaptability of our software to various
user environments.

Consolidating Controllers for Simplicity: Initially, our system featured separate controllers for
managing the planner system view and the event view. Although this design was functional and seemed
optimal, feedback suggested that it introduced excessive coupling, which could confuse or overwhelm
our customers. In response, we consolidated these into a single controller, utilizing the command
callback design pattern to maintain functionality while reducing complexity. This change has not
only simplified the user interface but also improved the overall user experience by providing a
more cohesive and intuitive interaction model.

Key Takeaways: These lessons have underscored the importance of designing with adaptability,
customer needs, and system simplicity in mind. Moving forward, we aim to continue these practices,
ensuring our software remains both powerful and user-friendly.

Experience with Providers

Accessibility and Support: Our experience with our software providers has been exceptionally
positive. They were consistently accessible and responsive, which greatly facilitated smooth
collaboration. Their readiness to engage and communicate was a key factor in the seamless
integration of their systems with ours.

Adaptability of Provided Solutions: The code we received from our providers was well-documented and
straightforward, making it easy to understand and adapt without the need for significant
modifications. This high level of code clarity and organization minimized our learning curve and
integration efforts.

Effective Communication and Compromise: Whenever challenges arose, our providers were quick to enter
into discussions, always open to feedback and willing to help find solutions. Their cooperative
approach helped us overcome hurdles efficiently, ensuring continuous progress and mutual
satisfaction.

Feedback and Improvement: The providers were always ready to receive and act upon feedback, which
fostered an environment of continuous improvement and trust. This proactive stance on feedback not
only enhanced the product but also reinforced a positive, productive partnership.

Conclusion: The helpfulness and approachability of our providers have not only made this
collaboration successful but also enjoyable. Their support has been instrumental in achieving our
project goals, and we look forward to maintaining this excellent relationship in future phases of
our development.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provided us with extensive learning opportunities across a wide array of
design patterns, including the Observer, Command, Factory, Strategy, and Command Callback patterns,
among others. Moreover, it enhanced our foresight in programming—teaching us to anticipate future
improvements and to develop code with our customers' needs in mind. These experiences have not only
broadened our technical expertise but also deepened our understanding of user-centric software
development.
